      you actually won't really need to use react.lazy anymore and that's because
      a brand new hook called use just simply use is being added to react and
      this use hook allows you to do a lot of really cool stuff it allows you to
      essentially asynchronously load things whether that's going to be
      asynchronously loading JavaScript files whether it's going to be
      asynchronously running different proc promises or maybe you even want to
      run your context through here all of those things are possible with the
      use hook it's honestly a rather complex hook that breaks all of the rules
      of normal hooks
    </div>
