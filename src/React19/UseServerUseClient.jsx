      Talking about the actual client versus server directives so you know that
      you can put use client or use server at the top of a file inside of nextjs
      to determine if that code is running on the server or if that code is
      being pushed down and ran on the client so this is just a really easy way
      for you to distinguish between these two things and right now it's really
      only usable inside of nextjs but with this newest version of react 19
      that's coming out this is going to be a stable release instead of
      something that is more of an experimental status which means other
      Frameworks can be built around these used client and used server features
      and we will hopefully see more Frameworks than just nextjs or remix
      actually have these used client and used server features and we can really
      start to play around with the power of this in more than just nextjs which
      I think is really cool and important because more and more Frameworks add
      to more Innovation which pushes all the Frameworks further.
