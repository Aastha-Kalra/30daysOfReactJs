      web components are going to work much better in react 19 they mention it
      very briefly inside this article it's like one sentence that they mention
      it but they do mention that web components are now going to be working
      much better with react 19 so if you want to use web components in react it
      should be much easier to implement them inside of a react project because
      in the past that was something that was really difficult which is why you
      would almost always see when you're working at libraries there would be a
      web component library and then like a react specific version because it
      was so hard to make web components work in react but now it should be much
      easier to get them to play well together
    </div>

export default WebComponents;
